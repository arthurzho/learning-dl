# learning-dl
## Goal
This repo is for my study on DL/ML. I'd like to record the long walking on this road.

This field is a little bit too big for me right now. I would like to cut this issue into three terms:

- Short Term: Python programming skill, Virturalization
- Middle Term: ML/DL models , classic algorithm implementation
- Long Term: Mathematics and Papers

## Roadmap
I borrow one picture from [Virgilio](https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio) as:
