# learning-dl
## Goal
This repo is for my study on DL/ML. I'd like to record the long walking on this road.

This field is a little bit too big for me right now. I would like to cut this issue into three terms:

- Short Term: Python programming skill, Virturalization
- Middle Term: ML/DL models , classic algorithm implementation
- Long Term: Mathematics and Papers

## Courses and projects
- The favorite __Course__ on this subjuct: [Deeping Learning by Andew on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- The favorite __GitHub__ : [Virgilio](https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio)
- Another useful __GitHub__:[从入门到进阶，所用到机器学习资料，包括书、视频、源码](https://github.com/linxid/Machine_Learning_Study_Path)
- Mathematics: [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html#sec4.5)
- [CNN Papers](https://github.com/robertsdionne/neural-network-papers)



There are several parts in this repo:
## Andrew-NG-DL-Course 
For: Asignments of Andrew NG's DL course

## Learning-Python
For: my learning on python

## Learning-Virgilio

## Try-Kaggle

## Misc
Tools and other useful stuffs

## Papers
Paper is difficult.
Paper is important.
