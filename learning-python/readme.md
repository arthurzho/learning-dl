### naive-ipython.ipynb

on Thursday, 23. May 2019 04:46PM 
I firstly practice python with Jupyter Notebook. This file is the output.
The code in this file is very naive. However, I will leave it here to urge me to move on

you should also know the shortcuts of Jupyter.
Magic happens when you press H or P at command mode

Practice the shortcuts in your later progrmming career. Enjoy it.

Everyday, the first line of python should be 
** import this **


### python_basic_cheatsheet.py

This file is much older than any others in this repo.
When I first learnt python, I coded this file in absolute python lines.

I wanted this file to record all the features of this programming language, and use it as a memo to copy some piece from it.

This file is only for grammars of python

### toy-tensorflow.ipynb
this fiile contains some simple features when I learn TensorFlow. I also wish to record my study roadmap of studying DL.
