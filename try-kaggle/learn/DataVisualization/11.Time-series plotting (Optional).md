In  all of the sections thus far our visualizations have focused on and  used numeric variables: either categorical variables, which fall into a  set of buckets, or interval variables, which fall into an interval of  values. In this notebook we will explore another type of variable: a  time-series variable.

 

```
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('max_columns', None)
import numpy as np
```

 

## Types of time series variables

Time-series  variables are populated by values which are specific to a point in  time. Time is linear and infinitely fine-grained, so really time-series  values are a kind of special case of interval variables.

Dates can show up in your dataset in a few different ways. We'll examine the two most common ways in this notebook.

In the "strong case" dates act as an explicit index on your dataset. A good example is the following dataset on stock prices:

 

```
stocks = pd.read_csv("../input/nyse/prices.csv", parse_dates=['date'])
stocks = stocks[stocks['symbol'] == "GOOG"].set_index('date')
stocks.head()
```

  

|            | symbol | open       | close      | low        | high       | volume     |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| date       |        |            |            |            |            |            |
| 2010-01-04 | GOOG   | 626.951088 | 626.751061 | 624.241073 | 629.511067 | 3927000.0  |
| 2010-01-05 | GOOG   | 627.181073 | 623.991055 | 621.541045 | 627.841071 | 6031900.0  |
| 2010-01-06 | GOOG   | 625.861078 | 608.261023 | 606.361042 | 625.861078 | 7987100.0  |
| 2010-01-07 | GOOG   | 609.401025 | 594.101005 | 592.651008 | 610.001045 | 12876600.0 |
| 2010-01-08 | GOOG   | 592.000997 | 602.021036 | 589.110988 | 603.251034 | 9483900.0  |

 

This dataset which is indexed by the date: the data being collected  is being collected in the "period" of a day. The values in the record  provide information about that stock within that period.

For daily data like this using a date like this is convenient. But a period can technically be for any length of time. `pandas` provides a whole dedicated type, the `pandas.Period` `dtype` (documented [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Period.html)), for this concept.

In the "weak case", dates act as timestamps: they tell us something  about when an observation occurred. For example, in the following  dataset of animal shelter outcomes, there are two columns, `datetime` and `date_of_birth`, which describe facts about the animal in the observation.

 

```
shelter_outcomes = pd.read_csv(
    "../input/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and/aac_shelter_outcomes.csv", 
    parse_dates=['date_of_birth', 'datetime']
)
shelter_outcomes = shelter_outcomes[
    ['outcome_type', 'age_upon_outcome', 'datetime', 'animal_type', 'breed', 
     'color', 'sex_upon_outcome', 'date_of_birth']
]
shelter_outcomes.head()
```

  

|      | outcome_type | age_upon_outcome | datetime            | animal_type | breed                   | color        | sex_upon_outcome | date_of_birth |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 0    | Transfer     | 2 weeks          | 2014-07-22 16:04:00 | Cat         | Domestic Shorthair Mix  | Orange Tabby | Intact Male      | 2014-07-07    |
| 1    | Transfer     | 1 year           | 2013-11-07 11:47:00 | Dog         | Beagle Mix              | White/Brown  | Spayed Female    | 2012-11-06    |
| 2    | Adoption     | 1 year           | 2014-06-03 14:20:00 | Dog         | Pit Bull                | Blue/White   | Neutered Male    | 2013-03-31    |
| 3    | Transfer     | 9 years          | 2014-06-15 15:50:00 | Dog         | Miniature Schnauzer Mix | White        | Neutered Male    | 2005-06-02    |
| 4    | Euthanasia   | 5 months         | 2014-07-07 14:04:00 | Other       | Bat Mix                 | Brown        | Unknown          | 2014-01-07    |

 

To put this another way, the stock data is aggregated over a certain  period of time, so changing the time significantly changes the data. In  the animal outcomes case, information is "record-level"; the dates are  descriptive facts and it doesn't make sense to change them.

 

## Visualizing by grouping

I  said earlier that time is a "special case" of an interval variable.  Does that mean that we can use the tools and techniques familiar to us  from earlier sections with time series data as well? Of course!

For example, here's a line plot visualizing which birth dates are the most common in the dataset.

 

```
shelter_outcomes['date_of_birth'].value_counts().sort_values().plot.line()
```

  

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d5058f908>
```

It looks like birth dates for the animals in the dataset peak at  around 2015, but it's hard to tell for sure because the data is rather  noisy.

Currently the data is by day, but what if we globbed all the dates together into years? This is known as **resampling**. We can do this to tweak the dataset, generating a result that's aggregated by year. The method for doing this in `pandas`, `resample`, is pretty simple. There are lots of potential resampling options: we'll use `Y`, which is short for "year".

 

```
shelter_outcomes['date_of_birth'].value_counts().resample('Y').sum().plot.line()
```

  

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d506e7fd0>
```

  

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/4327823/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..plJE4v89qMYPhrvPl5GEwQ.AHoMY7KUMyTvTM0A9kC34Kzu5uOuD5_eiI-lB-FyT-E-DGPtM8EV_Bg0nXQ88ybboIyrAXI51d8NPYAK_o3NvhB3NDP7j0QbjuqPbfhv3SBACIk6vPfRD6fqieYJt4Htgs1UWraAyCQsM8nDi58FdKYJrMchTmKrvN3EwtB-7Ro.FQtBbLvKSFdIzXneW4s5Sw/__results___files/__results___10_1.png) 

 

Much clearer! It looks like, actually, 2014 and 2015 have an almost equal presence in the dataset.

This demonstrates the data visualization benefit of resampling: by  choosing certain periods you can more clearly visualize certain aspects  of the dataset.

Notice that `pandas` is automatically adapting the labels on the x-axis to match our output type. This is because `pandas`  is "datetime-aware"; it knows that when we have data points spaced out  one year apart from one another, we only want to see the years in the  labels, and nothing else!

Usually the value of time-series data is exposed through this sort of  grouping. For example, here's a similar simple bar chart which looks at  the trade volume of the `GOOG` stock:

 

```
stocks['volume'].resample('Y').mean().plot.bar()
```

  

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d539c2cf8>
```

Most of the "new stuff" to using dates in your visualization comes  down to a handful of new data processing techniques. Because timestampls  are "just" interval variables, understanding date-time data don't  require any newfangled visualization techniques!

 

## Some new plot types

### Lag plot

One  of these plot types is the lag plot. A lag plot compares data points  from each observation in the dataset against data points from a previous  observation. So for example, data from December 21st will be compared  with data from December 20th, which will in turn be compared with data  from December 19th, and so on. For example, here is what we see when we  apply a lag plot to the volume (number of trades conducted) in the stock  data:

 

```
from pandas.plotting import lag_plot

lag_plot(stocks['volume'].tail(250))
```

  

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d53a1d7f0>
```

  

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/4327823/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..plJE4v89qMYPhrvPl5GEwQ.AHoMY7KUMyTvTM0A9kC34Kzu5uOuD5_eiI-lB-FyT-E-DGPtM8EV_Bg0nXQ88ybboIyrAXI51d8NPYAK_o3NvhB3NDP7j0QbjuqPbfhv3SBACIk6vPfRD6fqieYJt4Htgs1UWraAyCQsM8nDi58FdKYJrMchTmKrvN3EwtB-7Ro.FQtBbLvKSFdIzXneW4s5Sw/__results___files/__results___15_1.png) 

 

It looks like days when volume is high are somewhat correlated with  one another. A day of frantic trading does somewhat signal that the next  day will also involve frantic trading.

Time-series data tends to exhibit a behavior called **periodicity**:  rises and peaks in the data that are correlated with time. For example,  a gym would likely see an increase in attendance at the end of every  workday, hence exhibiting a periodicity of a day. A bar would likely see  a bump in sales on Friday, exhibiting periodicity over the course of a  week. And so on.

Lag plots are extremely useful because they are a simple way of checking datasets for this kind of periodicity.

Note that they only work on "strong case" timeseries data.

### Autocorrelation plot

A  plot type that takes this concept and goes even further with it is the  autocorrelation plot. The autocorrelation plot is a multivariate  summarization-type plot that lets you check *every* periodicity  at the same time. It does this by computing a summary statistic—the  correlation score—across every possible lag in the dataset. This is  known as autocorrelation.

In an autocorrelation plot the lag is on the x-axis and the  autocorrelation score is on the y-axis. The farther away the  autocorrelation is from 0, the greater the influence that records that  far away from each other exert on one another.

Here is what an autocorrelation plot looks like when applied to the stock volume data:

 

```
from pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot

autocorrelation_plot(stocks['volume'])
```

  

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f9d53905f28>
```

  

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/4327823/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..plJE4v89qMYPhrvPl5GEwQ.AHoMY7KUMyTvTM0A9kC34Kzu5uOuD5_eiI-lB-FyT-E-DGPtM8EV_Bg0nXQ88ybboIyrAXI51d8NPYAK_o3NvhB3NDP7j0QbjuqPbfhv3SBACIk6vPfRD6fqieYJt4Htgs1UWraAyCQsM8nDi58FdKYJrMchTmKrvN3EwtB-7Ro.FQtBbLvKSFdIzXneW4s5Sw/__results___files/__results___17_1.png) 

 

It seems like the volume of trading activity is weakly descendingly  correlated with trading volume from the year prior. There aren't any  significant non-random peaks in the dataset, so this is good evidence  that there isn't much of a time-series pattern to the volume of trade  activity over time.

Of course, in this short optional section we're only scratching the  surface of what you can do with do with time-series data. There's an  entire literature around how to work with time-series variables that we  are not discussing here. But these are the basics, and hopefully enough  to get you started analyzing your own time-dependent data!
