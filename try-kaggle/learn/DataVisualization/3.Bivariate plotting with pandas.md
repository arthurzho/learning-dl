In the previous notebook, we explored using `pandas` to  plot and understand relationships within a single column. In this  notebook, we'll expand this view by looking at plots that consider two  variables at a time.

Data without relationships between variables is the data science  equivalent of a blank canvas. To paint the picture in, we need to  understand how variables interact with one another. Does an increase in  one variable correlate with an increase in another? Does it relate to a  decrease somewhere else? The best way to paint the picture in is by  using plots that enable these possibilities.

 

```
import pandas as pd
reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data_first150k.csv", index_col=0)
reviews.head()
```

## Scatter plot

The simplest bivariate plot is the lowly **scatter plot**. A simple scatter plot simply maps each variable of interest to a point in two-dimensional space. This is the result:

 

```
reviews[reviews['price'] < 100].sample(100).plot.scatter(x='price', y='points')
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a986208>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___3_1.png) 

 

This plot shows us that price and points are weakly correlated: that  is, that more expensive wines do generally earn more points when  reviewed.

Note that in order to make effective use of this plot, we had to **downsample**  our data, taking just 100 points from the full set. This is because  naive scatter plots do not effectively treat points which map to the  same place. For example, if two wines, both costing 100 dollars, get a  rating of 90, then the second one is overplotted onto the first one, and  we add just one point to the plot.

This isn't a problem if it happens just a few times. But with enough  points the distribution starts to look like a shapeless blob, and you  lose the forest for the trees:

 

```
reviews[reviews['price'] < 100].plot.scatter(x='price', y='points')
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a8b3128>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___5_1.png) 

 

Because of their weakness to overplotting, scatter plots work best  with relatively small datasets, and with variables which have a large  number of unique values.

There are a few ways to deal with overplotting. We've already  demonstrated one way: sampling the points. Another interesting way to do  this that's built right into `pandas` is to use our next plot type, a hexplot.

 

## Hexplot

A  **hex plot** aggregates points in space into hexagons, and then colors those hexagons based on the values within them:

 

```
reviews[reviews['price'] < 100].plot.hexbin(x='price', y='points', gridsize=15)
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a81a898>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___8_1.png) 

 

(note: the x-axis is `points`, but is missing from the chart due to a bug)

The data in this plot is directly comparable with that in the scatter  plot from earlier, but the story it tells us is very different. From  this hexplot we can see that the bottles of wine reviewed by Wine  Magazine cluster around 87.5 points and around $20.

We did not see this effect by looking at the scatter plot, because  too many similarly-priced, similarly-scoring wines were overplotted. By  doing away with this problem, this hexplot presents us a much more  useful view of the dataset.

Hexplots and scatter plots can by applied to combinations of interval variables and/or ordinal categorical variables.

 

## Stacked plots

Scatter plots and hex plots are new. But we can also use the simpler plots we saw in the last notebook.

The easiest way to modify them to support another visual variable is  by using stacking. A stacked chart is one which plots the variables one  on top of the other.

We'll use a supplemental selection of the five most common wines for this next section.

 

```
wine_counts = pd.read_csv("../input/most-common-wine-scores/top-five-wine-score-counts.csv",
                          index_col=0)
```

 

`wine_counts` counts the number of times each of the possible review scores was received by the five most commonly reviewed types of wines:

 

```
wine_counts.head()
```

​      

|        | Bordeaux-style Red Blend | Cabernet Sauvignon | Chardonnay | Pinot Noir | Red Blend |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| points |                          |                    |            |            |           |
| 80     | 5.0                      | 87.0               | 68.0       | 36.0       | 72.0      |
| 81     | 18.0                     | 159.0              | 150.0      | 83.0       | 107.0     |
| 82     | 72.0                     | 435.0              | 517.0      | 295.0      | 223.0     |
| 83     | 95.0                     | 570.0              | 669.0      | 346.0      | 364.0     |
| 84     | 268.0                    | 923.0              | 1146.0     | 733.0      | 602.0     |

 

Many `pandas` multivariate plots expect input data to be  in this format, with one categorical variable in the columns, one  categorical variable in the rows, and counts of their intersections in  the entries.

Let's now look at some stacked plots. We'll start with the stacked bar chart.

 

```
wine_counts.plot.bar(stacked=True)
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a885278>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___15_1.png) 

 

Stacked bar plots share the strengths and weaknesses of univariate  bar charts. They work best for nominal categorical or small ordinal  categorical variables.

Another simple example is the area plot, which lends itself very naturally to this form of manipulation:

 

```
wine_counts.plot.area()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a6ff668>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___17_1.png) 

 

Like single-variable area charts, multivariate area charts are meant for nominal categorical or interval variables.

Stacked plots are visually very pretty. However, they have two major limitations.

The first limitation is that the second variable in a stacked plot  must be a variable with a very limited number of possible values  (probably an ordinal categorical, as here). Five different types of wine  is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable; eight is  sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. Many dataset fields will  not fit this critereon naturally, so you have to "make do", as here, by  selecting a group of interest.

The second limitation is one of interpretability. As easy as they are  to make, and as pretty as they look, stacked plots make it really hard  to distinguish concrete values. For example, looking at the plots above,  can you tell which wine got a score of 87 more often: Red Blends (in  purple), Pinot Noir (in red), or Chardonnay (in green)? It's actually  really hard to tell!

 

## Bivariate line chart

One  plot type we've seen already that remains highly effective when made  bivariate is the line chart. Because the line in this chart takes up so  little visual space, it's really easy and effective to overplot multiple  lines on the same chart.

 

```
wine_counts.plot.line()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f823a5ec588>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832509/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..zKjpSVfN8BnBsNA_ugph1w.uFT-SwisssAt-YPTUbnCTWbiO2cjCdFcmwmIp3rLq7CmUhs5dj85Yvaa8ec3dbSXLt68djbFH2QOsDVYa85Mi9VYtHAZEq9LKlZxXwRvY4f-HExVnGh8Q5MdPNJydM5nLG46_ofueS2u1j9KW0CKxiBycSy56170O0yozciXJ4E.PFIfcuHqmv4p8apr00UqzA/__results___files/__results___20_1.png) 

 

Using a line chart this way makes inroads against the second  limitation of stacked plotting: interpretability. Bivariate line charts  are much more interpretable because the lines themselves don't take up  much space. Their values remain readable when we place multiple lines  side-by-side, as here.

For example, in this chart we can easily answer our question from the  previous example: which wine most commonly scores an 87. We can see  here that the Chardonnay, in green, narrowly beats out the Pinot Noir,  in red.

## Exercises

In this section of the tutorial we introduced and explored some common bivariate plot types:

- Scatter plots
- Hex plots
- Stacked bar charts and area charts
- Bivariate line charts

Let's now put what we've learned to the test!

To start off, try answering the following questions:

1. A scatter plot or hex plot is good for what two types of data?
2. What type of data makes sense to show in a stacked bar chart, but not in a bivariate line chart?
3. What type of data makes sense to show in a bivariate line chart, but not in a stacked bar chart?
4. Suppose we create a scatter plot but find that due to the large  number of points it's hard to interpret. What are two things we can do  to fix this issue?

## Conclusion

In this section we introduced and explored some common bivariate plot types:

- Scatter plots
- Hex plots
- Stacked bar charts and area charts
- Bivariate line charts

In the next section we will move on to exploring another plotting library, `seaborn`, which compliments `pandas` with many more advanced data visualization tools for you to use.
