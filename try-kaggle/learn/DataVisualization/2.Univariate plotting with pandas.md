The `pandas` library is the core library for Python data  analysis: the "killer feature" that makes the entire ecosystem stick  together. However, it can do more than load and transform your data: it  can visualize it too! Indeed, the easy-to-use and expressive pandas  plotting API is a big part of `pandas` popularity.

In this section we will learn the basic `pandas` plotting  facilities, starting with the simplest type of visualization:  single-variable or "univariate" visualizations. This includes basic  tools like bar plots and line charts. Through these we'll get an  understanding of `pandas` plotting library structure, and spend some time examining data types.

 

```
import pandas as pd
reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data_first150k.csv", index_col=0)
reviews.head(3)
```

## Bar charts and categorical data

Bar  charts are arguably the simplest data visualization. They map  categories to numbers: the amount of eggs consumed for breakfast (a  category) to a number breakfast-eating Americans, for example; or, in  our case, wine-producing provinces of the world (category) to the number  of labels of wines they produce (number):

 

```
reviews['province'].value_counts().head(10).plot.bar()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837e131e48>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___3_1.png) 

 

What does this plot tell us? It says California produces far more  wine than any other province of the world! We might ask what percent of  the total is Californian vintage? This bar chart tells us absolute  numbers, but it's more useful to know relative proportions. No problem:

 

```
(reviews['province'].value_counts().head(10) / len(reviews)).plot.bar()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837dd66d30>
```

​

California produces almost a third of wines reviewed in Wine Magazine!

Bar charts are very flexible: The height can represent anything, as  long as it is a number. And each bar can represent anything, as long as  it is a category.

In this case the categories are **nominal categories**:  "pure" categories that don't make a lot of sense to order. Nominal  categorical variables include things like countries, ZIP codes, types of  cheese, and lunar landers. The other kind are **ordinal categories**:  things that do make sense to compare, like earthquake magnitudes,  housing complexes with certain numbers of apartments, and the sizes of  bags of chips at your local deli.

Or, in our case, the number of reviews of a certain score allotted by Wine Magazine:

 

```
reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837e015c50>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___7_1.png) 

 

As you can see, every vintage is allotted an overall score between 80  and 100; and, if we are to believe that Wine Magazine is an arbiter of  good taste, then a 92 is somehow meaningfully "better" than a 91.

 

## Line charts

The  wine review scorecard has 20 different unique values to fill, for which  our bar chart is just barely enough. What would we do if the magazine  rated things 0-100? We'd have 100 different categories; simply too many  to fit a bar in for each one!

In that case, instead of bar chart, we could use a line chart:

 

```
reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.line()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837dc05908>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___10_1.png) 

 

A line chart can pass over any number of many individual values,  making it the tool of first choice for distributions with many unique  values or categories.

However, line charts have an important weakness: unlike bar charts,  they're not appropriate for nominal categorical data. While bar charts  distinguish between every "type" of point line charts mushes them  together. So a line chart asserts an order to the values on the  horizontal axis, and the order won’t make sense with some data. After  all, a "descent" from California to Washington to Tuscany doesn't mean  much!

Line charts also make it harder to distinguish between individual values.

In general, if your data can fit into a bar chart, just use a bar chart!

 

## Quick break: bar or line

Let's do a quick exercise. Suppose that we're interested in counting the following variables:

1. The number of tubs of ice cream purchased by flavor, given that there are 5 different flavors.
2. The average number of cars purchased from American car manufacturers in Michigan.
3. Test scores given to students by teachers at a college, on a 0-100 scale.
4. The number of restaurants located on the street by the name of the street in Lower Manhattan.

For which of these would a bar chart be better? Which ones would be better off with a line?

## Area charts

Area charts are just line charts, but with the bottom shaded in. That's it!

 

```
reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.area()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837cc1cbe0>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___15_1.png) 

 

When plotting only one variable, the difference between an area chart  and a line chart is mostly visual. In this context, they can be used  interchangably.

 

## Interval data

Let's move on by looking at yet another type of data, an **interval variable**.

Examples of interval variables are the wind speed in a hurricane,  shear strength in concrete, and the temperature of the sun. An interval  variable goes beyond an ordinal categorical variable: it has a *meaningful* order, in the sense that we can quantify what the difference between two entries is itself an interval variable.

For example, if I say that this sample of water is -20 degrees  Celcius, and this other sample is 120 degrees Celcius, then I can  quantify the difference between them: 140 degrees "worth" of heat, or  such-and-such many joules of energy.

The difference can be qualitative sometimes. At a minimum, being able  to state something so clearly feels a lot more "measured" than, say,  saying you'll buy this wine and not that one, because this one scored a  92 on some taste test and that one only got an 85. More definitively,  any variable that has infinitely many possible values is definitely an  interval variable (why not 120.1 degrees? 120.001? 120.0000000001? Etc).

Line charts work well for interval data. Bar charts don't—unless your  ability to measure it is very limited, interval data will naturally  vary by quite a lot.

Let's apply a new tool, the histogram, to an interval variable in our  dataset, price (we'll cut price off at 200$ a bottle; more on why  shortly).

 

## Histograms

Here's a histogram:

 

```
reviews[reviews['price'] < 200]['price'].plot.hist()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837cc0e400>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___19_1.png) 

 

A histogram looks, trivially, like a bar plot. And it basically is!  In fact, a histogram is special kind of bar plot that splits your data  into even intervals and displays how many rows are in each interval with  bars. The only analytical difference is that instead of each bar  representing a single value, it represents a range of values.

However, histograms have one major shortcoming (the reason for our  200$ caveat earlier). Because they break space up into even intervals,  they don't deal very well with skewed data:

 

```
reviews['price'].plot.hist()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837cb82d68>
```

​      

 ![img](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/5832974/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..QOVW1MTTYpiGrMZEd13ZQw.Z4GnaBWa-6zN-nL8tdXmKnsZhAInZgY3SAnqUFkeB69Hl8pcMG4dLVcujCiIRp74OT8LXUNZdYU1m3h_3iv5w5nLVkEijWzJ9vT-0Bx9LIPAH7s6G1pgHmMnAYrWSfdj7Na8SPteB4vbMRwwFqFODoNMgEUSx1brkedLoNPR0Rw.kkWVXZWEWqLfmmQE6s8Ypw/__results___files/__results___21_1.png) 

 

This is the real reason I excluded the >$200 bottles earlier; some  of these vintages are really expensive! And the chart will "grow" to  include them, to the detriment of the rest of the data being shown.

 

```
reviews[reviews['price'] > 1500]
```

​

There are many ways of dealing with the skewed data problem; those  are outside the scope of this tutorial. The easiest is to just do what I  did: cut things off at a sensible level.

This phenomenon is known (statistically) as **skew**, and it's a fairly common occurance among interval variables.

Histograms work best for interval variables without skew. They also work really well for ordinal categorical variables like `points`:

 

```
reviews['points'].plot.hist()
```

​      

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f837cb00eb8>
```

​

## Exercise: bar, line/area, or histogram?

Let's do another exercise. What would the best chart type be for:

1. The volume of apples picked at an orchard based on the type of apple (Granny Smith, Fuji, etcetera).
2. The number of points won in all basketball games in a season.
3. The count of apartment buildings in Chicago by the number of individual units.

## Conclusion and exercise

In  this section of the tutorial we learned about the handful of different  kinds of data, and looked at some of the built-in tools that `pandas` provides us for plotting them.

Now it's your turn!

For these exercises, we'll be working with the Pokemon dataset (because what goes together better than wine and Pokemon?).

 

```
pd.set_option('max_columns', None)
pokemon = pd.read_csv("../input/pokemon/pokemon.csv")
pokemon.head(3)
