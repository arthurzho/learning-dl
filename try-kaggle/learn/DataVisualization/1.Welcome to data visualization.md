Welcome to the Data Visualization tutorial!

Data visualization is one of the core skills in data science. In  order to start building useful models, we need to understand the  underlying dataset. You will never be an expert on the data you are  working with, and will always need to explore the variables in great  depth before you can move on to building a model or doing something else  with the data. Effective data visualization is the most important tool  in your arsenal for getting this done, and hence an critical skill for  you to master.

In this tutorial series, we will cover building effective data visualizations in Python. We will cover the `pandas` and `seaborn` plotting tools in depth. We will also touch upon `matplotlib`, and discuss `plotly` and `plotnine`  in later (optional) sections. We still start with simple  single-variable plots and work our way up to plots showing two, three,  or even more dimensions. Upon completing this tutorial you should be  well-equipped to start doing useful exploratory data analysis (EDA) with  your own datasets!

## Prerequisites

There's one thing to do before we get started, however: learn about `pandas`, the linchpin of the Python data science ecosystem. `pandas`  contains all of the data reading, writing, and manipulation tools that  you will need to probe your data, run your models, and of course,  visualize. As a result, a working understanding of `pandas` is critical to being a sucessful builder of data visualizations.

If you are totally unfamiliar with `pandas`, the following prerequisites will cover just enough `pandas`  to get you started. These tutorial sections are targetted at total  beginners; if you are already at least mildly familiar with the library,  you should skip ahead to the next section.

Each section will focus on one particular aspect of plotting in  Python, relying on the knowledge you have aquired up until that point to  get the job done.
